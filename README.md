### Start server
Go to the directory and run this command :
```
node server.js
```

### Rebundle after change
In the project directory run :
```
npm run bundle
```

### Caution
I'm aware that the views generator script is unreadable, will make it human as soon as possible.
Serving static files from the root makes the user able to access your server.js, which is bad in terms of security. Will change the tree to fix this issue.
